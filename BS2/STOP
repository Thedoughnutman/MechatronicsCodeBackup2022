'SOURCE: STOP
'This program is similar to END, NAP, and SLEEP except that the LED 
'will not blink since the STOP command prevents the BASIC Stamp from
'entering low power mode at the end of the code.  Use the circuit 
'shown in the description of the SLEEP command for this example.

Main:
  LOW 0                                 'turn LED on
  STOP                                  'stop program
